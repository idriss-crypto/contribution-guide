# IDriss Contribution Guide

✨ Welcome! ✨ 

Contributions are welcome from anyone, and even the smallest of fixes, suggestions, and reports are appreciated!

Below you can find guidelines for contributing to IDriss and its [repositories](https://github.com/idriss-crypto).
Please follow these guidelines to the best of your ability. Also, feel free to propose any changes
to this document in a pull request.

## Find things you can work on

IDriss is currently being built by a team of core contributers. In an effort to include the [community](https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5) 
in more and more steps of the development, please familiarize yourself with the points below. 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5) is always a good place to start discussions around feature requests and bugs.


## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo you would like to work on
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the setup instructions in the readme file
4. Find an issue you would like to work on, or open a new one. Make sure to not open duplicate issues.
5. Build!
6. Open a PR against the main branch and describe the change the PR has
   implemented. In your PR description, make sure to mark that your
   PR closes the associated issue from step 4.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

- There are no compiling time errors, typos, syntax errors, uses of undeclared variables, calls to undefined or deprecated functions.
- The code is commented so that your pet could understand it.
- You provide tests, where necessary.


Once a PR is open, a reviewer will answer within 1-2 days 
(weekends and holidays will probably extend this timeline). 
The reviewer will leave requests for adjustments or 
approve and merge the PR when it is ready for inclusion in the
code base.
